This is my personal store of dotfiles, installation scripts and customizations
(Oh My!).  It is by no means complete, and caution is suggested when blindly
installing something.  It is shared with the intent that you take what you
need and ignore the rest.

If you find problems, make an issue. Have a suggestion, submit a pull request.
